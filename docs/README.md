Future iterations include what is below, maintaining the overall focus of serving as a Companion to the Make School student populace!*

## Version 1.0 ##
1. Tracks **attendance** of students as they enter the campus *(Authorized Make School Students)*.
2. Visually display a MS student's **projects** and **courses**!

## Version 1.1 ##
1. Extend beacon functionality to **classrooms**!
2. Foolproof **entering** and **exiting** tracking!
3. **MAYBE** Geofence!
