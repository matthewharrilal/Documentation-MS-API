# What the heck is a Geofence? #

### *Geofences are virtual fences we can put on a designated area. The purpose of a geofence can range from a tactful marketing tool to tracking whether a student entered the building or not! When the student enters the campus their phone then enter's this geofence, therefore tracking if the user is entering or leaving the campus!* ###
